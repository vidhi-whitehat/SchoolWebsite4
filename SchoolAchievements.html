                            Our team started off well as it had most of the ‘brain boxes’ of our school. Everyone contributed equally to the debate. In the end, when the judges announce the winner, we were overjoyed! The judges commented that though the B team fought well, it was the A team which had knowledge and fluency on its side!

                            This event is one of the biggest international school events of its kind in Europe and the first time many young international students from the Malaga and Cadiz provinces will have ever played competitive football against other schools. Girls and boys from 7 to 16 years old will be competing in 230 matches over three days.

                            Science projects are the perfect way for high school students to have fun exploring science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Our high school projects are written and tested by scientists and are specifically created for use by students in the high school grades. Students can choose to follow the science experiment as written or put their own spin on the project.
